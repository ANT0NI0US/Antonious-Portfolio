      "This is what I have done since a month after joining Smart Gate company, and I am not allowed to use the source code according to the current contract between us. This project allows any user, whether a company, organization, or any website, to integrate a chat feature on their platform. This chat can contain any desired content, such as messages or the addition of workdays, with the ability to specify the working hours. Additionally, users can define multiple pathways to enable them to choose the desired route. The platform also allows the creation of forms through which users can be asked various questions, and the collected data is recorded according to the preferences of the chat's creator. Furthermore, users can ask and respond to questions, add images for display, and download any data as per the preferences of the individual who built the interface.",
